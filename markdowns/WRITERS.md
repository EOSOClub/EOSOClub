## 🎨 Writing Styles We Need

**We want:** "Ready for some fun? Type /play to start your adventure!"

### 🤖 **Bot Response Makeover**

### 🏰 **Server Description Makeover**

**Before:** "A Discord community for gamers featuring bots, events, and friendly members."

**After:** "Welcome to Empire of Shadows - where gaming meets legend. Forge friendships in our chaotic-fun realm, command ancient bots with personality, and write your story in a community that remembers your name. Your throne awaits..."
